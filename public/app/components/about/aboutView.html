							The galactic zoo was created with the support of universities, research organizations, corporations, science academies and enthusiastic union citizens. Permission was sought from the Galactic Republic to present a Zoo Proposal. With its enthusiastic acceptance, the search for a host planet began. This candidate planet required adherence to numerous criteria. Some were, stability in a calm system, a completely sterile world vacant of all present and former life, of a size and density that would readily accept terra-forming and located in a region safe from the <span class="dictionary">Nyrryn</span>. Numerous worlds were considered. One was chosen in the Sagittarius Arm, Pluthos System, sixth planet. A totally frozen world, its orbit was gradually repositioned to become a moon of the fourth planet. Planet engineers adjusted the system’s gravitational dynamics, to maintain stability, removing rogue asteroids and comets to establish calm, safe orbits for all system residents. The 70 year process gradually released frozen water and gases from the planet. Terra-formers fine tuned the planet dynamics creating the world now known as Hamingja.

					Hamingja (pronounced “HAHM-ing-ya”) derives its name from ancient Earth Norse mythology. The word means “a part of the soul (strength, skill, knowledge, luck) that is passed on from generation to generation”. A name befitting the philosophy that sparked the birth of The Galactic Zoo. Visitors come to the Zoo to experience the wonderous and diverse lifeforms of our galaxy. Here are housed extraordinary exhibits found no where else. However, the major purpose of the Zoo is for discovery and research. A vast network of engineers, scientists, designers, explorers and teachers dedicate their careers to continually expanding our understanding of the endless variation and abundance of life throughout the cosmos. An academy has been founded that is exclusively dedicated to training the next generation of bio-miners and environmental engineers while also providing educational access to other centers of learning across the galaxy.

					The Galactic Zoo evolved from a spirit of cooperation and a desire for knowledge, inviting all to experience the unbounded diversity of life throughout the cosmos. The ongoing quest of the Zoo is to discover, research and catalog the galaxy’s near-infinite life forms and bioments gaining an evergrowing understanding of the universe. The Galactic Zoo was founded on the premise that all life is sacred no matter how bizarre.

				<br />
				<p>IT IS PLEDGED</p>
				<ul>
					<li>To respect and preserve all forms of life no matter how bizarre.</li>
					<li>To harvest and return, as a zoo resident, samples of life for all to experience and appreciate.</li>
					<li>To protect and leave undisturbed all environs visited.</li>
					<li>To seek a better understanding of life&#8217;s origins.</li>
					<li>To determine how the web of life&#8217;s energy influences the cosmos.</li>
