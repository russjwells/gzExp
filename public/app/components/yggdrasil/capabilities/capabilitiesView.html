			<h2>DEEP SPACE RESEARCH / HARVEST VESSEL</h2>
			<p>
				A battalion of task-specific robots continually patrol the ship - monitoring systems, making repairs, managing environmental systems for both crew and harvests. Many are specifically built for open space excursions assuring the integrity of ship skin and exterior networks. Docking bays are designed for specific uses. Supplies, materials and transport equipment are brought aboard using Decks 5 - 8. These are some of the largest platforms and are equalled only by the large harvest entry/ exit ports near the ship’s belly. Crew board by way of spine entries, port or starboard, near crew quarters and recreational. Terrestrial travel craft are quartered in the stern above the gravity plates and just aft of the forward time folding array. Here also reside extensive garage/repair bays. Two enormous bays are dedicated to extra-terrestrial vehicular repair and maintenance. Upgrades and refitting for specific environments are also handled in these areas. . Harvest holds have been designed with extra reinforcement against internal and external forces to keep crew and harvest safe. Should an emergency occur where the ship needs evacuation, the harvest area can become its own independent, maneuverable craft. It can separate from the main ship and autonomously travel to a safe location. This has been planned as a means to assure the safety of harvested creatures. Should an emergency require complete ship evacuation, 90 lifeboats positioned port and starboard are within ready reach just aft of the crew quarters.

			<h2>SYSTEM ARRIVAL PROTOCOL</h2>
			<p>
				Upon arrival at its destination, normal protocol requires the Ygg to station itself in the outer reaches of a solar system, well away from any gravitational disturbances that may be caused by the time compressors. From this location it becomes the command center for the system-wide survey. Interplanetary craft are then sent on various pre-planned missions, while autonomous recon craft are also deployed, gathering information for excursions which are planned post-arrival. Onboard computers assure a continuous chatter of information with the Galactic Zoo Command Center on Hamingja via the timetether link. Compressor bands are left active as anchors at travel tunnel entry and exit to keep the portals open so an unbroken stream of data is maintained. Ship systems are monitored at all times. This also includes all away vessels as the various planet missions are executed. Micro systems in the clothing and terrestrial suits of the crew are also communicating with the Ygg command center reporting on individual crew condition, stresses and location. The Yggdrasil command center monitors progress of all activities and can respond to any contingency that may arise during explore and harvest missions.

			<h2>INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL</h2>
			<p>
				The Yggdrasil boasts one of the latest space travel advances with its Voyage Assist Space- Time (VAST) Drive System. This drive creates a sustained time bubble through which the ship voyages along an artificial time-folded passage through space. This passage or tunnel is condensed between the point of origin and the destination. Distances between locations cannot be changed, but the time to cross those distances can be greatly shortened. Time within the ship is not distorted but remains connected with the normal cosmic continuum. During travel, an etherial time tether is maintained between locations. This tether is not only a connection to the normal flow of time, but is also used as a communications link along which information can be exchanged at a rate much faster than the speed of light q A gravitational push-pull drive system is used for interplanetary travel and when VA ST is operating. This method of travel projects a powerful gravitational field in front of the ship thus causing the vessel to, in a sense, fall forward. A repulsive field is also projected to the rear of the ship thus pushing it forward. These fields compress space in front while expanding space aft q At the beginning of an excursion, autonomous compressor bands are launched to create a time passage. These bands create a minute worm hole to the intended destination through which nano-tech spores are transported instantaneously (“threading the needle”). Material larger than these spore would require more energy than current technology can manage. The tech-spore then begin the work of assembling compressor bands at the destination. When this is complete and the connection between locations is secure, the time portal is opened. The space faring ship enters and the voyage begins y
